# av-hikeathon
Analytics Vidhya Hikeathon

(iterating quickly on April 10th to ensure compliance)

Throughout the day will add:
* basic setup
* pre-processing where the features are created using most of the data to get averages and counts, and a separate holdout set for the modeling set; this is already available in `explore_2.R`
* screenshots of our Driverless AI models (four roughly similar models, blended together evenly)
* high level description and observations
* machine specifications this was run on (workstation with dual processors, 128GB RAM, Titan XP GPU for Driverless AI)

Cheers!
Will be updating quickly
